Movie Recommender System
The Movie Recommender project uses Autoencoders for collaborative filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. Autoencoders are neural networks designed to learn efficient representations of data. The system works by understanding users' preferences and suggesting movies that they are most likely to enjoy.

Features

Personalized Recommendations: Recommends movies to users based on their individual preferences and ratings.
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interactions (e.g., movie ratings) to find patterns and make recommendations.
Autoencoders: A type of neural network used to learn efficient representations of usersâ€™ preferences to predict movie ratings.
Dataset
The model uses a dataset containing movie ratings from users. Each rating corresponds to a user's opinion about a specific movie. The dataset may include:

User ID: A unique identifier for each user.
Movie ID: A unique identifier for each movie.
Rating: A rating that the user gives to a movie, typically on a scale of 1-5.
For this project, datasets like MovieLens are often used, containing millions of ratings from various users across hundreds of movies.

Model Architecture

The Movie Recommender system uses an Autoencoder with the following architecture:

Encoder: Compresses the user-item interactions into a lower-dimensional space (latent features).
Decoder: Reconstructs the ratings from the latent features to predict missing ratings.
The loss function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and actual ratings.
